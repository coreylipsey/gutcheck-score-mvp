I began by conducting extensive market research, interviewing potential customers, and developing a prototype. Within 6 months, I had my first paying customer and have since grown to serve 15 clients across three states. I've learned to pivot quickly based on customer feedback and have developed strong relationships with suppliers and distributors."

I also analyzed our cost structure and identified areas where we could optimize without sacrificing quality. Within two weeks, I had secured new supplier agreements that actually reduced our costs by 15% while maintaining product quality."
