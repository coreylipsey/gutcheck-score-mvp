# Gutcheck.AI Agent System

AI-powered assessment agents for instant entrepreneurial evaluation and feedback.

## 🎯 Strategic Vision

Gutcheck.AI is building intelligent agents to transform entrepreneurial assessment from a 24+ hour manual process into an instant, intelligent, and scalable system.

### Why Agents? The 3-Question Test

✅ **High Frequency**: 50-100+ assessments processed daily  
✅ **Time Sensitive**: Delays cost revenue through lead cooling  
✅ **Rule-Based**: Clear scoring and feedback patterns  

## 🚀 Current Focus: Assessment Analysis Agent

**Phase 1 Pilot**: Instant assessment analysis and feedback generation

**Target Impact:**
- **99.7% Faster Response**: 24+ hours → <30 seconds
- **10x Cost Reduction**: $100+ → <$1 per assessment  
- **Improved User Experience**: Instant gratification
- **24/7 Availability**: No human bottlenecks

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Framework: LangChain
- **Predictable Workflows**: Assessment analysis follows consistent patterns
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive tools for data processing and analysis
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested in enterprise environments
- **Observability**: Excellent monitoring and debugging capabilities

### Technology Stack
- **LangChain**: Primary agent framework
- **Python**: Backend development
- **FastAPI**: API development
- **PostgreSQL**: Data storage
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Primary LLM
