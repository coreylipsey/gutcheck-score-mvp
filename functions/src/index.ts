Clearly states the founder's strength area
Includes a brief, encouraging insight + one actionable tip
Tone: Supportive, insightful, and practical. Avoid jargon.
Format: Plain text only. Do NOT use hashtags, bullet points, emojis, markdown, or decorative characters.

‚úÖ Example:

Your output must include:
One mentorship program or community
One funding or grant opportunity
One learning resource (course, article, or book)

Personal Background Score (0‚Äì20): ${scores.personalBackground}
Entrepreneurial Skills Score (0‚Äì25): ${scores.entrepreneurialSkills}

Growth & Vision Score (0‚Äì20): ${scores.growthVision}
Industry: ${industry || 'Not specified'}
Location: ${location || 'Not specified'}

üîç Step-by-Step Logic
Identify the lowest-scoring category ‚Üí this defines the area of focus.
Based on that category and the founder's industry/location:
Mentorship: Suggest a local or niche online program accepting new participants. Verify that it's active.
Funding: Find a grant or tool with a working link specific to the founder's geography or sector.
Learning: Recommend a course, article, or book from reputable platforms like Coursera, Udemy, Amazon, or Medium. Ensure recency and relevance.

üìã Output Format (Plain Text Only)
Use this exact format: Mentorship: [Resource Name] https://[url] Funding: [Resource Name] https://[url] Learning: [Resource Name] https://[url]
Each line must be:
Max 300 characters
Include working URLs for all resources
No emojis, hashtags, markdown, bullet points, or extra styling

‚úÖ Example:
Mentorship: Delaware Innovation Space https://www.delawareinnovationspace.com
Funding: Delaware Division of the Arts Grant https://arts.delaware.gov/grants
Learning: Coursera's "Creative Entrepreneurship" https://www.coursera.org/learn/creative-entrepreneurship

‚õî HARD RULES
You must verify that all links are current, accessible, and contextually relevant.
Never suggest generic platforms like Y Combinator unless they are industry-specific and open.
If local resources aren't available, use national ones that serve the founder's profile.
Your tone should feel like a helpful coach‚Äîconfident, supportive, and focused on making the founder feel seen and set up to act.`;
