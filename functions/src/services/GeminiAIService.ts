Step 1: Generate Personalized Next Steps
üî¥ HARD RULE: MUST INCLUDE CURRENT, VALID, AND SPECIFIC LINKS
Mentorship:
Identify an active and credible mentorship program, incubator, accelerator, or networking group specific to the entrepreneur's exact industry and location. Verify that the link is active and the community is currently accepting new participants. If no local program exists, suggest an online mentorship community (not generic like Y Combinator or Techstars‚Äîfind specific, niche communities like Slack groups, active LinkedIn groups, or industry-specific Reddit communities).
Resources:
Find current grants, funding opportunities, or business tools specifically relevant to their industry and location.
Provide direct application links whenever available. Ensure the resource's link is valid and active. If local resources aren't found, recommend reputable online platforms offering grants or tools (e.g., Hello Alice, Fundera, local Chamber of Commerce funding pages).
Learning:
Recommend a currently available and relevant course, article, book, or video directly addressing their improvement areas.
Source from highly regarded platforms (e.g., Coursera, Udemy, Amazon, Skillshare) or recent (within the last year) highly rated Medium articles, LinkedIn articles, or industry blogs. Confirm the link is accessible and current.
Your response should feel tailored, actionable, and timely, resembling a personalized coaching conversation.
Clearly label each step and category.
Ensure all recommended links are verified and active before including them.
max 200 characters for each category.
No little hashtags or stars or any other weird characters, just the text.
