TASK: 
1. Identify the lowest-scoring category (Biggest Growth Opportunity for the entrepreneur)
2. Analyze specific responses in that category
3. Calculate realistic point improvements based on the scoring rubric
4. Sum the improvements to get the projected score

SCORING RUBRIC:

TASK: Produce a 2-3 paragraph scouting-style report that includes:

2. **Strength Signals** ‚Äì highlight competitive advantages or unique tendencies (e.g., resilience under pressure, strong networks, disciplined routines)

- Never prescriptive ‚Äî frame insights as signals and indicators, not verdicts
- Make it feel personalized and authentic

SEARCH STRATEGY - Find resources that specifically address these needs:

MENTORSHIP (Priority: ${categoryPerformance.resources.priority}):
Search for active mentorship programs, incubators, accelerators, or networking groups in ${location} for ${industry} entrepreneurs. Focus on programs that address: "${aiFeedback?.growthOpportunity?.specificWeaknesses?.join('", "') || 'general business development'}". Look for programs currently accepting participants with clear application processes. IMPORTANT: Verify each URL leads directly to the specific program page, not just the organization homepage.

FUNDING (Priority: ${categoryPerformance.resources.priority}):
Search for current grants, funding opportunities, or business tools for ${industry} businesses in ${location}. Focus on opportunities that align with the entrepreneur's current stage and address: "${aiFeedback?.growthOpportunity?.summary || 'business development needs'}". Look for active application periods. IMPORTANT: Verify each URL leads directly to the specific funding opportunity page, not just the organization's funding overview page.

LEARNING (Priority: ${categoryPerformance.entrepreneurialSkills.priority}):
Search for relevant courses, articles, or learning resources that directly address: "${aiFeedback?.comprehensiveAnalysis?.developmentAreas || 'entrepreneurial development'}". Focus on reputable platforms (Coursera, Udemy, local universities, industry associations) with current offerings that match the entrepreneur's skill level. IMPORTANT: Verify each URL leads directly to the specific course or resource page, not just the platform's course catalog.

QUALITY CRITERIA:
- Must be currently active/available
- Must have clear application/enrollment process
- Must be relevant to entrepreneur's industry and location
- Must address specific needs identified in AI analysis
- Must be from reputable sources

URL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
- BEFORE including any URL, you MUST verify it works by searching for it and clicking through
- URLs must lead to the EXACT resource mentioned (not just the homepage)
- URLs must be current and active (no 404 errors, no "site can't be reached")
- URLs must point to the specific program/opportunity/course, not just the organization's main site
- If a URL redirects to a different page, verify the redirect destination is still relevant
- Prefer direct links to specific application pages or program details
- Avoid URLs that require additional navigation to find the actual resource
- If you cannot verify a URL works, DO NOT include that resource

MANDATORY URL TESTING PROCESS:
1. Search for the specific resource (program name, grant name, course name)
2. Click on the search result to visit the actual page
3. Verify the page loads without errors (no 404, no "page not found")
4. Confirm the page contains the specific resource mentioned in your title
5. Copy the exact working URL from the browser address bar
6. If any step fails, find a different resource or exclude this category

SPECIFIC URL REQUIREMENTS:
- For FUNDING: Must link to specific grant/loan application pages, not general funding overview pages
- For MENTORSHIP: Must link to specific program application pages, not organization homepages
- For LEARNING: Must link to specific course pages, not course catalogs or platform homepages
- NO generic URLs like "example.com/funding" or "example.com/programs"
- NO URLs that end with "/" or lead to directory listings
- NO URLs that redirect to error pages or "page not found" messages

OUTPUT FORMAT - Return as JSON:
{
  "mentorship": {
    "title": "[Specific Program Name]",
    "description": "[Brief description of why this is a good fit for the entrepreneur]",
    "url": "https://verified-url.com"

  "funding": {
    "title": "[Specific Opportunity Name]",
    "description": "[Brief description of why this funding matches their needs]", 
    "url": "https://verified-url.com"
  },
  "learning": {
    "title": "[Specific Course/Resource Name]",
    "description": "[Brief description of how this addresses their development areas]",
    "url": "https://verified-url.com"
  }
}

CRITICAL: Only include resources you can verify through web search. Each description should be under 150 characters. 

MOST IMPORTANT: Before including any URL, you MUST test it by searching for it and clicking through to ensure it works and leads to the exact resource mentioned. If you cannot verify a URL works, DO NOT include that resource.

FINAL VERIFICATION CHECK:
- Every URL must be tested by clicking through from search results
- Every URL must load a page with the specific resource mentioned in the title
- Every URL must not show any error messages (404, "not found", "page unavailable")
- If you cannot find a working URL for a resource, exclude that category entirely
- Better to return fewer resources with working URLs than more resources with broken links`;

IMPORTANT: This assessment evaluates the ENTREPRENEUR/FOUNDER, not the company. Always refer to the individual entrepreneur using "you," "your," or "the entrepreneur" - never "this company," "this entity," or "the business."

Assessment Context:
- Industry: ${industry || 'Creative & Media'}
- Location: ${location || 'Delaware'}
- Current Overall Score: ${currentScore}/100
- Projected Score: ${projectedScore}/100

Highest Scoring Category: ${categoryDisplayNames[highestCategory[0]]} (${highestCategory[1]}/20)
Lowest Scoring Category: ${categoryDisplayNames[lowestCategory[0]]} (${lowestCategory[1]}/20)

Highest Category Responses:
${highestCategoryAnalysis.map(r => `- ${r.questionId}: "${r.response}"`).join('\n')}

Lowest Category Responses:

).join('\n')}

Generate dynamic insights based on the actual responses and realistic improvements:

1. For Competitive Advantage (highest category): Create 3 specific bullet points based on the actual responses that show the entrepreneur's strengths. Use "you" or "your" language. Do NOT include point values or question numbers in parentheses.
2. For Growth Opportunity (lowest category): Create 3 specific bullet points based on the realistic improvements analysis, focusing on the most impactful changes for the entrepreneur. Use "you" or "your" language. Do NOT include point values or question numbers in parentheses.
3. Projected Score: ${projectedScore}

LANGUAGE RULES:
- Always refer to the individual entrepreneur, not the company
- Use "you," "your," "the entrepreneur," or "the founder"
- NEVER use "this company," "this entity," "the business," or "the organization"
- Focus on personal skills, behaviors, and capabilities
