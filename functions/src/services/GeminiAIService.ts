- Resources & Network: ${scores.resources}/20
- Behavioral Metrics: ${scores.behavioralMetrics}/15
- Growth & Vision: ${scores.growthVision}/20
- Overall Score: ${overallScore}/100

TASK: 
1. Identify the lowest-scoring category (Biggest Growth Opportunity for the entrepreneur)
2. Analyze specific responses in that category
3. Calculate realistic point improvements based on the scoring rubric
4. Sum the improvements to get the projected score

SCORING RUBRIC:
- Multiple choice: Specific point values (e.g., "Weekly"=5, "Monthly"=4, "Occasionally"=3)
- Open-ended: AI scored 1-5 based on quality and depth

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):

- Use "you" or "your" language when referring to the entrepreneur`;

- Growth & Vision: ${scores.growthVision}/20

TASK: Produce a 2-3 paragraph scouting-style report that includes:
1. **Signal Readout** ‚Äì interpret the score and explain what it means in context, like a scout explaining combine numbers
2. **Strength Signals** ‚Äì highlight competitive advantages or unique tendencies (e.g., resilience under pressure, strong networks, disciplined routines)
3. **Development Areas** ‚Äì note where signals suggest gaps or undervalued traits (e.g., limited capital access, inconsistent tracking, hesitation in risk-taking)
4. **Trajectory Indicators** ‚Äì suggest next moves or opportunities that could elevate their "market value" as an entrepreneur (like a coach pointing out how to turn raw talent into production)

OUTPUT FORMAT: Plain text, 2-3 paragraphs

TONE GUIDANCE:
- Warm, constructive, growth-oriented ‚Äî like a scout who genuinely wants the player to succeed
- Honest but encouraging, balancing candor with motivation
- Specific, concrete observations rather than generic praise/criticism
- Use metaphors where helpful (e.g., "You've built a strong baseline, but your goal-tracking is like a quarterback with good instincts who hasn't yet mastered the playbook")
- Never prescriptive ‚Äî frame insights as signals and indicators, not verdicts
- Make it feel personalized and authentic

LANGUAGE RULES:
- ALWAYS use first person: "you," "your," "yourself" - never "the entrepreneur," "the founder," or third person
- NEVER use "this company," "this entity," "the business," or "the organization"
- Focus on personal skills, behaviors, and capabilities
- Be consistent throughout - every sentence should use "you" language`;

Mentorship:
Identify an active and credible mentorship program, incubator, accelerator, or networking group specific to the entrepreneur's exact industry and location.

If no local program exists, suggest an online mentorship community (not generic like Y Combinator or Techstars‚Äîfind specific, niche communities like Slack groups, active LinkedIn groups, or industry-specific Reddit communities).
Resources:
Find current grants, funding opportunities, or business tools specifically relevant to their industry and location.
Provide direct application links whenever available. Ensure the resource's link is valid and active. If local resources aren't found, recommend reputable online platforms offering grants or tools (e.g., Hello Alice, Fundera, local Chamber of Commerce funding pages).
Learning:
Recommend a currently available and relevant course, article, book, or video directly addressing their improvement areas.
Source from highly regarded platforms (e.g., Coursera, Udemy, Amazon, Skillshare) or recent (within the last year) highly rated Medium articles, LinkedIn articles, or industry blogs. Confirm the link is accessible and current.
Your response should feel tailored, actionable, and timely, resembling a personalized coaching conversation.
Clearly label each step and category.
Ensure all recommended links are verified and active before including them.

Highest Scoring Category: ${categoryDisplayNames[highestCategory[0]]} (${highestCategory[1]}/20)
Lowest Scoring Category: ${categoryDisplayNames[lowestCategory[0]]} (${lowestCategory[1]}/20)

Highest Category Responses:
${highestCategoryAnalysis.map(r => `- ${r.questionId}: "${r.response}"`).join('\n')}

Lowest Category Responses:
${lowestCategoryAnalysis.map(r => `- ${r.questionId}: "${r.response}"`).join('\n')}

Realistic Improvements Analysis:

).join('\n')}

Generate dynamic insights based on the actual responses and realistic improvements:

1. For Competitive Advantage (highest category): Create 3 specific bullet points based on the actual responses that show the entrepreneur's strengths. Use "you" or "your" language. Do NOT include point values or question numbers in parentheses.
2. For Growth Opportunity (lowest category): Create 3 specific bullet points based on the realistic improvements analysis, focusing on the most impactful changes for the entrepreneur. Use "you" or "your" language. Do NOT include point values or question numbers in parentheses.
3. Projected Score: ${projectedScore}

LANGUAGE RULES:
- Always refer to the individual entrepreneur, not the company
- Use "you," "your," "the entrepreneur," or "the founder"
- NEVER use "this company," "this entity," "the business," or "the organization"
- Focus on personal skills, behaviors, and capabilities
