- Industry: {industry or 'Not specified'}
- Location: {location or 'Not specified'}

FOCUS AREA: {format_category_name(lowest_category)} (Lowest scoring category: {lowest_score}/{get_category_max(lowest_category)})

TASK: Generate 3-4 actionable next steps with real, verified URLs.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the google_search tool to find real, working URLs for each recommendation
2. Focus on the lowest-scoring category as the primary improvement area
3. Consider their industry and location when making recommendations
4. Provide specific, actionable steps, not generic advice
5. Each step should include a real URL to a legitimate resource
6. Base recommendations on their actual responses, not generic advice

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Write 3-4 specific next steps, each with:
- A clear, actionable recommendation
- A real URL to a legitimate resource
- Brief explanation of why this step is important for them

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
"1. [Specific Action]: [Real URL] - [Brief explanation based on their responses]"

Use the google_search tool to find real URLs for:
- Mentorship programs (SCORE, local business mentors)
- Funding resources (SBA, local grants, accelerators)
- Learning resources (Coursera, Udemy, industry-specific courses)
- Networking opportunities (local chambers, industry groups)
- Tools and platforms (based on their specific needs)

Return only the formatted next steps with real URLs."""
