CURRENT SCORES:
- Personal Foundation: {scores.get('personalBackground', 0)}/20
- Entrepreneurial Skills: {scores.get('entrepreneurialSkills', 0)}/25
- Resources: {scores.get('resources', 0)}/20

- Overall Score: {total_score}/{max_possible} ({percentage:.1f}%)
- Industry: {industry or 'Not specified'}
- Location: {location or 'Not specified'}

TASK: Create a comprehensive sports scouting report style analysis.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Write a detailed analysis in the style of a professional sports scouting report. Include:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (2-3 sentences)
2. STRENGTHS (3-4 specific strengths based on their actual responses)
3. AREAS FOR DEVELOPMENT (3-4 specific areas based on their actual responses)
4. PLAYER COMPARISON (compare to a well-known entrepreneur or business leader)
5. PROJECTION (3-5 year outlook based on their current profile)
6. RECOMMENDATIONS (3-4 specific, actionable recommendations)

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use sports scouting terminology and style
- Base all analysis on their actual responses, not generic advice
- Be specific about what they said and how it demonstrates strengths/weaknesses
- Use concrete examples from their answers
- Make the analysis personal and actionable
- Focus on their unique situation and background
- Use the exact wording from their selected responses when referencing them

EXAMPLE STYLE:
"PLAYER PROFILE: This founder shows strong fundamentals with room for growth..."
