EXAMPLE SPECIFIC BULLETS:

- "Strong network utilization (leveraged friend's support effectively)"
- "Growth mindset (weekly professional learning commitment)"
- "Resilience and adaptability (bounced back from business challenges)"

AVOID GENERIC BULLETS LIKE:
- "Strong foundation in business fundamentals"
- "Demonstrated problem-solving abilities"
- "Commitment to continuous learning"
- "Resilient approach to challenges"

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Identify the highest-scoring category
- Analyze specific responses in that category to find evidence of strengths
- Create 4 specific, evidence-based strengths from their actual responses
- Each strength MUST include specific details from their responses (e.g., "Strategic problem-solving approach (demonstrates handling cash flow crisis)")
- Make each strength specific and actionable with concrete examples
- Focus on competitive advantages that set them apart from other entrepreneurs
- Include regional/industry context if available
- Avoid generic phrases like "strong foundation" or "demonstrated abilities"
- Use specific examples, numbers, or concrete actions from their responses
- Each bullet should feel like it came from analyzing their actual answers, not generic advice"""
