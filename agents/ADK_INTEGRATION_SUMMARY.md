- **Competitive Advantage Analysis** (`competitive_advantage.py`)
  - Analyzes highest-scoring category
  - Identifies specific strengths based on actual responses
  - Returns structured analysis with category, score, summary, and strengths

- **Growth Opportunity Analysis** (`growth_opportunity.py`)
  - Analyzes lowest-scoring category
  - Identifies improvement areas based on actual responses
  - Returns structured analysis with category, score, summary, and weaknesses

- **Comprehensive Analysis** (`comprehensive_analysis.py`)
  - Generates sports scouting report style analysis
  - Includes executive summary, strengths, development areas, player comparison, projection, and recommendations
  - Based on actual assessment responses

- **Next Steps Generation** (`next_steps.py`)
  - Generates actionable next steps with real, verified URLs
  - Uses web search for legitimate resources
  - Focuses on lowest-scoring category for improvement

- **Key Insights Generation** (`key_insights.py`)
  - Creates 3-sentence executive summary
  - Captures overall assessment and key takeaways
  - Based on actual responses and scores

##### Question Scoring Tools
- **Individual Question Scoring** (`question_scoring.py`)
  - Scores open-ended questions on 1-5 scale
  - Provides explanations based on response quality
  - Handles all question types

- **Enhanced Question Scoring** (`enhanced_question_scoring.py`)
  - Advanced scoring with detailed analysis
  - Includes strengths, areas for improvement, key insights, and recommendations
  - More comprehensive than basic scoring

#### 3. Safety Systems
- **Content Filter** (`content_filter.py`)
  - Filters requests for safety and appropriateness
  - Identifies prohibited topics and high-risk content
  - Provides risk assessment (low/medium/high/critical)

- **Human Oversight** (`human_oversight.py`)
  - Evaluates requests for human review requirements
  - Maintains review queue for flagged content
  - Provides escalation mechanisms

#### 4. API Endpoints
- **Health Check** (`GET /`) - Server status and agent information
- **Agent Info** (`GET /agent-info`) - Detailed agent and tool information
- **Coordinated Request** (`POST /coordinated-request`) - Main multi-agent endpoint
- **Legacy Compatibility** (`POST /generate-feedback`) - Backward compatibility

- **Tools**: Integrated with ADK's `google_search` for real URL verification
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms for production reliability

### Mock Implementation for Testing
- Created mock responses for all tools to enable testing without API credentials
- Maintained production-ready structure for easy credential integration
- All tools return properly formatted responses matching expected schemas
