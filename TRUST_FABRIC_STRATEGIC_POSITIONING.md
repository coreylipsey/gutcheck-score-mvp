```

interface AssessmentSession {
  valueClassification: {
    personalSignals: string[]; // Individual insights
    enterpriseSignals: string[]; // Cohort patterns  
    proprietarySignals: string[]; // Gutcheck.AI proprietary
  };
  dataLineage: {
    source: 'personal_assessment' | 'enterprise_cohort';
    valueContainment: boolean;
  };
}
